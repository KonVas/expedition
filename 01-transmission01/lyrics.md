Hailing vessel 7327-CK01 reconnaissance frigate Mercurial Intonation.
Sacred orders from the Grand Assembly of the Minister Absolute are
as follows:

Recent breakthroughs in century-old research has led our scientists to
believe that there is intelligent life in the system of Sol. You are
instructed to travel to Sol, in search of this intelligent life. Your
mission is for reconnaissance only; engage stealth measures at all
times. Use orbital observation and sanctioned data capture techniques
only; atmospheric probes are acceptable but do not attempt full
atmospheric entry, surface landing, or Ars Suit observation. A complete
xenographic record of the entire system is required, but data suggests
that Sol's third planet may be ripe with undiscovered and uncategorized
life.

Your mission has been cleared for escape burn at 8103.7 standard
Arsian time.
