# Production Details

Aside from the drum breaks on _Selfies_, all audio for 
_Expedition_ was originally produced by 
Mike Hodnick (a.k.a. [Kindohm](http://github.com/kindohm)) with
[FL Studio](https://www.image-line.com/flstudio/) soft-synths
and hardware analog synths.

## Instruments and Software

- FL Studio soft-synths
	- Harmor
	- Sytrus
	- 3x OSC
- analog synths
	- Arturia Minibrute
	- Elektron Analog RYTM
	- Korg Volca Keys
- Composition and Performance
	- Tidal

## Production (recording, mixing, mastering)

All recording, mixing, and mastering was performed with FL Studio.

A Focusrite Scarlett 18i8 was used with SPDIF loopback to capture and
record Tidal audio through Windows system audio. External 
synths were also captured from the Scarlett. 

## Track Notes

### Humans Riding Bicycles Taking Selfies
Bass line performed on a Minibrute.
Drum breaks are a part of an old, free collection of drum breaks
produced and released by Dave Akuma.

### Sorting Through Wreckage
This track is composed entirely of MIDI code (no samples were used). Three 
external instruments were used live on this track:

- Analog RYTM (drums)
- Minibrute (bass)
- Volca Keys (sustained chords)

One fun thing in particular is that the RYTM's performance pads were 
controlled from code using control-change commands.
